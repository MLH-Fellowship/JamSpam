# JamSpam

> A Machine Learning powered GitHub App built with [Probot](https://github.com/probot/probot) to jam the spam PRs on your repo and keep maintainers stress-free (even in Hacktober ðŸŽƒ)

## Summary

### Building Dataset

- We listed links of PRs labelled as âš  `SPAM` or `INVALID` âš  on some popular repositories especially those that faced a pool of spam pull-requests during the recently concluded Hacktoberfest ðŸŽƒ in a [`.csv` file](jam-spam-ml/data/spam.csv).
- Similarly, we also listed links of âœ… `MERGED` PRs on the repositories in a separate [`.csv` file](jam-spam-ml/data/ham.csv) for Ham (not Spam) features.
- We used [Octokit](https://octokit.github.io/), an API framework by GitHub to extract Pull Request Information from the PR links and save desired features locally to build our model.

### Feature Extraction

We chose the standard PR attributes and some derived features to train our model

- **Standard**
    - *Number of Commits*
    - *Number of Files Changed*
    - *Number of Changes* `(Additions + Deletions)`
- **Derived**
    - *Number of Files Changed of Documentation Type*
        ```py
        # File Extensions considered to be of Doc-Type 
        ['md', 'txt', 'rst', '']
        ```
    - *Occurences of spam hit-words in text corpus of PR*
        
        Text Corpus of a Pull Request includes the PR Title, Body, Commit Messages and Diffs.

        All text is pre-processed with regex to exclude any symbols.

### Model Design 

We are using Keras to build our baseline model. It is essentially a (5-16-16-1) Sequential Neural Network with first three layers being 'RELU' activated and the final output layer activated as a sigmoid function.

The model is run over 500 epochs with a unit batch size.

### Transfer Model to Bot

The model is exported from Python using `tensorflowjs` that creates a `model.json` and a `.bin` file to store the model structure, variables and associated weights.

The model is imported seamlessly into Node.js using `@tensorflow/tfjs-node` for predictions to be made for incoming PRs
